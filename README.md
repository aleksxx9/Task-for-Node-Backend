 # Frontend
 Frontend is written with vanilla javascript. To run front-end you can simply copy the path of index.html file and paste it in your browser eg. C:\Users\..\..\Task-for-Node-Backend\Frontend\index.html. Otherwise you can start frontend with live server if using Visual Sturio Code
## Note: frontend fetches information from hosted backend, so you dont need to run backend in order for logs to work
 
 # Backend
 To run backend firstly go to project directory and run "npm install" command. After succesfull instalation you can run with comand "node server.js" or "npm start". To run backend with doker you can run following commands: "docker build -t tic-tac-toe ." after image was successfuly built you can run container with "docker run -p 3000:3000 -d tic-tac-toe" and your app will run on localhost:3000
